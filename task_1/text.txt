Go ahead and park after dark, fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls. When night falls, I am your escape
When you lay alone, I ache. Something I wanted to feel
If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love,
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need.
Not anyone, you're the one. More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want, sincerity
